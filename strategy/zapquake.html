		<h2>Zapquake</h2>
		<p>Zapquake refers to using a combination of lightning spells and earthquake spells to take out enemy buildings, most notably air defenses. The lightning spell is unlocked by building your spell factory at town hall level 5, the earthquake spell is unlocked by building your dark spell factory at town hall level 8 and upgrading it to level 2.</p>
		<p>The lightning spell deals a set amount of damage that depends only on its level. The damage done by the earthquake spell however depends not only on the level of the spell but also on the amount of hitpoints the targeted buildings have. Furthermore, successive earthquake spells deal increasingly less damage. You should therefore never use more than one earthquake spell on the same building.</p>
		<p>This means that, when using zapquake, there are two possible ways to use your spells. You can either use 1 earthquake spell and 2 lightning spells, or just lightning spells. Let's call the former zapquake and the latter zap.</p>
