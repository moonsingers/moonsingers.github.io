		<h1>Town Hall 8</h1>
		<p>Here you can find help and strategies for Town Hall level 8.</p>
		<h3>General Info</h3>
			<p class="general">When you get to Town Hall 8, you will get a couple more defensive buildings you already had (Archer Tower, Hidden Tesla, Mortar, Wizard Tower) and some more storages. A new but not so interesting defense is the Bomb Tower. Upgrading your Barracks will unlock the Pekka, a slow-but-heavy-hitter. Upgrading your Dark Barracks (of which you now have two) will unlock the valkyrie, who can hit two buildings at once, and the golem, who does almost no damage but has tons of health. Also important: the Dark Spell Factory. This new building allows you to make the Poison Spell (which damages enemy troops) at level 1 and the Earthquake Spell (which damages enemy buildings) at level 2.</p>

		<h3>Strategies</h3>
			<p>Common strategies for Town Hall 8 include:
			<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
				<li>Dragloon</li>
					<ul>
						<li>This strategy is rather straightforward. You use 10 dragons from your camps, and 5 balloons from your clan castle. You have two options when it comes to your choice of spells: either you use lightning and earthquake or you use rage and poison. If you choose the former, use your spells to destroy 1 or 2 air defenses and funnel your dragons such that they will attack the remaining air defenses. Drop your loons such that they will path to the remaining air defenses, but only when you are sure that the defenses are targeting the dragons. If you choose the latter, use the poison for the enemy clan castle troops and use the rages to boost your dragons and loons when they are under fire from the air defenses.</li>
