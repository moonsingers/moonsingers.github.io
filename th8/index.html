		<h1>Town Hall 8</h1>
		<p>Here you can find help and strategies for Town Hall level 8.</p>

		<h3>When you get to Town Hall 8, you will get a couple more defensive buildings you already had (Archer Tower, Hidden Tesla, Mortar, Wizard Tower) and some more storages. A new but not so interesting defense is the Bomb Tower. Upgrading your Barracks will unlock the Pekka, a slow-but-heavy-hitter. Upgrading your Dark Barracks (of which you now have two) will unlock the valkyrie, who can hit two buildings at once, and the golem, who does almost no damage but has tons of health. Also important: the Dark Spell Factory. This new building allows you to make the Poison Spell (which damages enemy troops) at level 1 and the Earthquake Spell (which damages enemy buildings) at level 2.</h3>
